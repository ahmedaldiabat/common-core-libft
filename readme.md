# Libft

## Description
Libft is a custom C library created as part of the 42 curriculum.  
The goal of this project is to reimplement essential standard C library functions from scratch in order to gain a deeper understanding of memory management, string manipulation, linked lists, and general low-level programming logic.  
The library provides a collection of functions that can be reused across future 42 projects and personal C applications.

## Instructions

### Compilation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/libft.git
    cd libft
    ```

2. Compile the library by running the following command:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    This will compile the library and generate the `libft.a` static library file.

3. If you want to clean up object files and other temporary files generated during compilation, you can run:
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```

4. To remove the `libft.a` static library and clean all object files, run:
    ```bash
    make fclean
    ```

5. To recompile the library (after running `make fclean` or if you want to recompile), you can use:
    ```bash
    make re
    ```

### Installation

- To use the library in your project, simply copy or link the `libft.a` file into your project directory.
- Add the path to `libft.a` in your compilation commands. For example:
    ```bash
    gcc -o your_program your_program.c -L/path/to/libft -lft
    ```

### Usage

After compiling, the functions in the `libft` library are ready to be used in your project. Just include the `libft.h` header at the top of your C files where you want to use the library functions:

```c
#include "libft.h"

### AI Usage

In this `libft` project, **AI-assisted tools** were used to help with the following tasks:

1. **Code Review & Optimization**  
   AI was used to analyze the written functions and suggest possible optimizations. For example, it assisted in improving the performance of certain string manipulation functions (such as `ft_strcpy` and `ft_strcat`) by recommending more efficient memory usage strategies or algorithmic improvements.

2. **Functionality Testing**  
   AI tools were leveraged to automatically generate test cases for edge cases that could have been missed, such as testing memory overflows, invalid inputs, and boundary conditions in functions like `ft_memcpy` and `ft_memset`. This automated testing helped ensure the robustness of the library.

3. **Documentation & Commenting**  
   AI-assisted documentation tools were employed to generate initial docstrings and comments for each function, ensuring that the codebase remains well-documented and readable. This was especially helpful for functions that involve intricate memory manipulation or pointer arithmetic, where clarity is essential.

4. **Code Style Enforcement**  
   AI-powered linters were used to enforce consistent code styling (e.g., indentation, naming conventions) according to the project's coding standards. This helped maintain uniformity and readability throughout the project.

5. **Refactoring Suggestions**  
   In cases where certain functions were overly complicated or could benefit from a simpler approach, AI tools suggested refactoring strategies to improve both performance and maintainability without altering the intended functionality.

While AI was instrumental in suggesting improvements and providing testing insights, the actual implementation, design decisions, and algorithmic choices were made by the developer to maintain the integrity and educational value of the project.
